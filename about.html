    			<h2>About Donation </h2>
    			<p>Muskan Foundation , an NGO for poor child education, is an NGO in India directly benefitting over 15,00,000 children and their families every year, through more than 400 live welfare projects on education, healthcare, in over 2000 remote villages and slums across 25 states of India.

					Education is both the means as well as the end to a better life: the means because it empowers an individual to earn his/her livelihood and the end because it increases one's awareness on a range of issues – from healthcare to appropriate social behaviour to understanding one's rights – and in the process help him/her evolve as a better citizen.</p>
